🔹 Project Overview

This project analyzes marketing campaign performance data to evaluate the effectiveness of campaigns across different channels, regions, and time periods.
The primary objective is to measure ROI, identify high- and low-performing campaigns, and support data-driven marketing budget decisions.

The project demonstrates real-world marketing analytics, KPI calculation, and business-focused insight generation.

🔹 Business Problem

Marketing teams often run multiple campaigns simultaneously but lack clarity on:

Which campaigns deliver the highest return on investment (ROI)

Which channels and locations perform best

Whether higher spending actually leads to better engagement and profitability

Objective:
Analyze campaign performance metrics to optimize marketing spend and improve overall ROI.

🔹 Dataset

Source: Kaggle (Marketing Campaign Dataset)

Size: ~200,000 campaign records

Each record represents a marketing campaign execution

Key attributes include:

Campaign ID

Impressions, Clicks

Conversion Rate

Acquisition Cost

ROI

🔹 Methodology
1️⃣ Data Preparation

Validated campaign metrics for logical consistency

Converted date and cost fields into usable formats

Removed invalid records (e.g., clicks > impressions)

2️⃣ Feature Engineering & KPIs

Calculated key marketing performance indicators:

Conversions (derived from clicks and conversion rate)

Cost per Click (CPC)

Cost per Conversion

Return on Investment (ROI)

3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis

Channel-wise ROI comparison

Campaign type performance analysis

Cost vs engagement relationship

Location-wise and time-based performance trends

🔹 Key Insights

Certain marketing channels consistently deliver higher ROI than others

High acquisition cost does not always result in higher engagement or profitability

Campaign performance varies significantly by location and campaign type

Seasonal trends influence overall marketing effectiveness

🔹 Business Recommendations

Increase budget allocation to consistently high-ROI channels

Reduce or redesign campaigns with persistent negative ROI

Optimize campaigns with high cost but low engagement scores

Use location-based and seasonal insights for targeted marketing strategies

Track ROI as a primary KPI instead of impressions or clicks alone
